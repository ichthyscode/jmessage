This project includes a SQLite database file named `lutherbibel_1545.sqlite` which contains the text of the Luther Bible 1545. To use this database in your application, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that the `lutherbibel_1545.sqlite` file is located in the root directory of the project.
2. Use the following code snippet to connect to the SQLite database:

```go
import (
    "database/sql"
    _ "github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3"
    "log"
)

func main() {
    db, err := sql.Open("sqlite3", "./lutherbibel_1545.sqlite")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    defer db.Close()

    // Your database operations go here
}
```

3. You can now perform SQL queries on the `lutherbibel_1545.sqlite` database to retrieve the text of the Luther Bible 1545 as needed for your application.
